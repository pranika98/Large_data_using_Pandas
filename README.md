# Large_data_using_Pandas

Pandas is one of the most popular Data Science libraries used globally. It is well documented and is easy to use, offering numerous features at our disposal. Even with all it merits pandas face the hurdles of large datasets in its smooth questioning. To tackle this challenge of large datasets one of the effective solutions is to **read the entire data in chunks** with the chunksize depending on your RAM.

This can be achieved by using the function `<read_csv()>`which contains `chunksize` as an optional parameter.
